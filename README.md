Hi! Thanks for downloading my little game

This game requires 2 IRL people to play

So basically there are 3 rows and columns, labeled 0, 1, and 2

You have choose a column then a row for your turn

The first one to get 3-in-a-row wins!


Have fun! :DD

Also you might get a notifcation saying that the program is a virus, ignore it because it's a false positive
